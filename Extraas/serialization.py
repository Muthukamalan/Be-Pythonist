# Serialization
# It is the process of converting an object or data structure into a sequence of bytes or a stream of data, so that it can be stored or transmitted as a file or over a network. This process allows an object or data structure to be reconstructed from the serialized data at a later time.

# why pickle? python natively supports all type in pickle
